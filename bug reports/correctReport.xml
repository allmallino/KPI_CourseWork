        Users have reported that when attempting to open the settings page, the application crashes unexpectedly.
        This issue seems to occur consistently when navigating to the "General" tab within the settings.
        This problem is critical as it prevents users from accessing and configuring important application settings.
        A screen capture of the error is attached for reference (see screen_capture.png).
